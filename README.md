# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help develop code that can scrape data about the planet Mars from various space websites. After collecting the data, storing them in a database, Flask is used to present the information on an HTML page. Using Bootstrap 3, various elements of the HTML page are modified and enhanced to make the website interface more user-friendly and aesthetically-pleasing.
